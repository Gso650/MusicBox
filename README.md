A multi-platform GUI application for creating music strips for 15 note music boxes. Completed in about four days as a Mother's Day gift. Thanks to the JUCE library, this project can be easily compiled for Linux, Mac OS, and iOS. It would almost certainly be possible to compile it for Windows and Android as well, but I haven't tried it personally.

This application provides tools for designing and playing back songs for 15 note music boxes. Songs can be saved and loaded for continued editing, and can be played back at varying speeds. Once completed, songs can be printed or exported as music strips. Once the strips are cut out and each note is punched out, the music strips can be fed directly into a DIY 15 note music box to play back the song.

For more information about DIY music boxes, I recommend checking out [Darren Embry's music box paper repository](https://github.com/dse/music-box-paper), he explains the concept better than I could.

This project was made much easier due to the wealth of free image and audio resources available online. See the [attribution page](Attribution.md) for the full list of resources used in this project.
